# Increment and Decrement Operators in C

## 🧠 Introduction

In C, **increment** and **decrement** operators are **unary operators** (they work on a single operand).  
They are used to **increase or decrease** the value of a variable by `1`.

These operators are very common in **loops**, **counters**, and **expressions**.

## ⚙️ Types of Operators

### 1. Increment Operator (`++`)
Increases the value of a variable by `1`.

### 2. Decrement Operator (`--`)
Decreases the value of a variable by `1`.

## 🔄 Forms of Increment/Decrement Operators

Both operators have **two forms**:

| Type | Example | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Pre-increment** | `++x` | Increments `x` first, then uses the updated value. |
| **Post-increment** | `x++` | Uses the current value of `x` first, then increments it. |
| **Pre-decrement** | `--x` | Decrements `x` first, then uses the updated value. |
| **Post-decrement** | `x--` | Uses the current value first, then decrements it. |
